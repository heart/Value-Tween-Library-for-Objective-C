Value Tween Library for Objective-C
=======

1. link "QuartzCore.framework".
2. copy "Tween.h" "Tween.m" "TweenObject.h" "TweenObject.m" to your project.
3. import "Tween.h" and import "TweenObject.h".
4. call and implement a callback.
5. enjoy!!


Example Usage
=============

```objc
#import "Tween.h"
#import "TweenObject.h"

- (IBAction)buttonWasTapped:(id)sender
{
    [Tween addTween:self
            tweenId:0
         startValue:10
           endValue:290
               time:2
              delay:0
             easing:@"easeNone"
           startSEL:nil
          updateSEL:@selector(update:)
             endSEL:@selector(end:)];
}

- (void)update:(TweenObject *)tween
{
    self.view.frame  = CGRectMake(tween.currentValue,  5,20,20);
}
- (void)end:(TweenObject *)tween
{
    self.view.frame  = CGRectMake(tween.currentValue,  5,20,20);
}
```

UPDATE BY heart

```objc
[Tween addTween:self tweenId:0 .........

//Stop Tween By tweenId
[Tween stopTweenId:0];



TweenObject *tw_obj = [Tween addTween:self tweenId:1 .........

//Stop Tween by TweenObject
[Tween stopTweenObject:tw_obj];
```
